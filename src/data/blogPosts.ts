    content: `## What Is the Cuba E-Visa?

The Cuba e-visa is the electronic replacement for the old pink tourist card (tarjeta del turista) that was previously required for US citizens traveling to Cuba. Since Cuba digitized its entry authorization system, all travelers must now obtain an e-visa before boarding any flight to Cuba.

The e-visa is a single-entry authorization valid for 30 days from your arrival date, with the option to extend for an additional 30 days at an Inmigración office inside Cuba. It must be used within 180 days of issuance.

## Who Needs a Cuba E-Visa?

All US citizens, regardless of age, need a valid Cuba e-visa to enter Cuba. This applies whether you're traveling by air or by cruise ship. Cuban-born Americans holding US passports also need the e-visa — plus a valid Cuban passport if they were born on the island.

## OFAC Travel Categories for US Citizens

Under US law, American citizens must travel to Cuba under one of 12 OFAC-authorized categories. The most commonly used category is **"Support for the Cuban People,"** which covers most leisure-oriented travel. Other categories include:

- Family Visits
- Official Government Business
- Journalistic Activity
- Professional Research
- Educational Activities
- Religious Activities
- Public Performances and Exhibitions
- Humanitarian Projects
- Activities of Private Foundations
- Exportation, Importation, or Transmission of Information
- Other OFAC-Authorized Transactions

**No license application is required** — you self-certify your travel category when applying for your e-visa.

## How Much Does a Cuba E-Visa Cost?

Packages from authorized providers like Cuba Travel Services start at:

- **$85** — Standard Cuba E-Visa with same-day email delivery
- **$135** — Express Cuba E-Visa with ~10-minute delivery, includes D'Viajeros assistance
- **$225** — Signature Service with VIP immigration processing and optional airport lounge access

## How to Apply for Your Cuba E-Visa

1. **Choose your service package** — Standard, Express, or Signature
2. **Complete the online application** — Passport details, travel dates, OFAC category
3. **Pay securely** — US credit cards accepted (unlike the Cuban government site)
4. **Receive your e-visa by email** — Instantly for Express, same-day for Standard

## What Is the D'Viajeros Form?

The D'Viajeros (Declaración de Viajero) is Cuba's mandatory digital health and customs declaration. Every traveler must submit this form before departure. It is separate from your e-visa. Express and Signature packages from Cuba Travel Services include D'Viajeros completion assistance.

## Can I Get a Cuba Visa at the Airport?

You cannot obtain a Cuba e-visa on arrival in Cuba. However, Cuba Travel Services has physical staff at American Airlines and Delta at Miami International Airport (MIA) and Southwest Airlines at Tampa International Airport (TPA) for last-minute assistance before your departure.

## Key Takeaways

- All US citizens need a Cuba e-visa — no exceptions
- Self-certify your OFAC travel category (no license required)
- Apply online from an authorized provider for instant delivery
- The D'Viajeros form is separate and also mandatory
- Extend your stay by 30 days at Inmigración inside Cuba`,

    content: `## Understanding OFAC Travel Categories

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), part of the US Department of the Treasury, regulates travel to Cuba for US citizens. While tourism is not permitted, 12 authorized categories cover virtually every type of meaningful travel.

## The Most Popular Category: Support for the Cuban People

Approximately 85% of US travelers to Cuba use the **"Support for the Cuban People"** category. This category requires that your activities:

- Directly engage with the Cuban people
- Support independent Cuban entrepreneurs
- Result in meaningful interaction with Cuban citizens

In practice, this means staying at private casa particulares (homestays), eating at privately owned restaurants (paladares), and engaging with local artisans and businesses rather than exclusively using state-run hotels and services.

## Other Common Categories

### Family Visits
For travelers visiting close relatives who are Cuban nationals or residents. No limit on duration of stay.

### Religious Activities
Organized religious trips including mission work, church-to-church exchanges, and faith-based humanitarian activities.

### Educational Activities (People-to-People)
Structured educational programs with a full schedule of activities. Must be organized by a licensed organization.

### Journalism
For journalists, reporters, photographers, and filmmakers working on Cuba-related content. Freelance journalists qualify.

### Humanitarian Projects
Activities related to humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and public health initiatives.

### Professional Research
Academic research and professional meetings requiring direct engagement in Cuba.

## How to Self-Certify

You do **not** need to apply for a specific license from OFAC. Self-certification means:

- You declare your travel category on your e-visa application
- You keep records of your activities for 5 years
- You can demonstrate your activities align with the declared category if asked

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Don't choose a category that doesn't match your plans** — This creates unnecessary legal exposure
- **Don't assume you need a license** — Self-certification is sufficient for all 12 categories
- **Do keep receipts and records** — OFAC requires 5 years of documentation retention
- **Do support Cuban private businesses** — This is especially important under "Support for the Cuban People"

## Getting Help

When you apply through Cuba Travel Services, our team helps you select the correct OFAC category during the application process. Our document review process ensures your paperwork aligns with your declared travel purpose.`,

    content: `## What Is the D'Viajeros Form?

The D'Viajeros (short for Declaración de Viajero or Traveler's Declaration) is Cuba's mandatory digital health and customs declaration form. Every traveler — regardless of nationality — must complete and submit this form before departing for Cuba. Every traveler — regardless of nationality — must complete and submit this form before departing for Cuba.

## Is It the Same as the Cuba E-Visa?

**No.** The D'Viajeros form and the Cuba e-visa are two completely separate requirements:

- **E-Visa** = Your travel authorization to enter Cuba (replaces the old tourist card)
- **D'Viajeros** = Your health and customs declaration (required in addition to the e-visa)

You need both to board your flight to Cuba.

## What Information Does the D'Viajeros Require?

The form asks for:

- Full legal name (as on passport)
- Passport number and nationality
- Flight information (airline, flight number, date)
- Accommodation details in Cuba
- Health declaration (medications, recent illnesses)
- Customs declaration (currency amounts, prohibited items)
- Contact information

## When Should I Submit the D'Viajeros?

Submit the D'Viajeros form **within 72 hours before your departure** to Cuba. Submitting too early may cause issues — the system expects recent submissions.

## Common D'Viajeros Mistakes

1. **Wrong passport number** — Triple-check this field; errors can delay boarding
2. **Incorrect flight details** — Make sure airline and flight number match exactly
3. **Submitting too early** — Stay within the 72-hour window
4. **Not saving the confirmation** — Screenshot or print the QR code you receive
5. **Forgetting to complete it** — Airlines may deny boarding without proof of submission

## Getting Help with D'Viajeros

Cuba Travel Services includes D'Viajeros completion assistance in all Express ($135) and Signature ($225) packages. Our team completes the form correctly on your behalf, eliminating the risk of errors that could delay your trip.

For travelers who purchase the Standard e-visa ($85), standalone D'Viajeros assistance is available for $15.`,

    category: "Visa Guide",
    date: "February 13, 2026",
    readTime: "5 min read",
    content: `## The Old System: Paper Tourist Cards

For decades, Cuba required all visitors to purchase a physical tourist card — a small paper form that served as your entry authorization. US citizens received a **pink card**, while travelers from other countries received a **green card**.

These cards were typically purchased at:
- Airline check-in counters (if available)
- Travel agencies
- Cuban embassies or consulates

The system was outdated, prone to errors, and created bottlenecks at departure gates.

## The New System: Digital E-Visa

Cuba has modernized its entry system with a fully electronic visa (e-visa). The e-visa is:

- **Digital** — Delivered to your email, no physical card needed
- **Pre-validated** — Your information is checked against consulate requirements before issuance
- **Instant** — Express delivery takes approximately 10 minutes
- **Portable** — Present it digitally on your phone or print a copy

## What's Actually Different?

| Feature | Old Tourist Card | New E-Visa |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Format | Paper card | Digital PDF |
| Delivery | In-person pickup | Email delivery |
| Processing | Manual | Automated with validation |
| Corrections | Start over with new card | Can be corrected digitally |
| Cost for US citizens | $50–$100+ | From $85 |

## Why This Matters for US Travelers

The transition to e-visas eliminates several pain points:

1. **No more scrambling at the airport** — Apply from home days before your trip
2. **No more handwriting errors** — Digital forms prevent common mistakes
3. **No more lost cards** — Your e-visa lives in your email, backed up in the cloud
4. **Faster processing** — Express delivery in ~15 minutes vs. days or weeks

## Are the Requirements the Same?

Yes. The actual requirements for entering Cuba haven't changed — only the format. You still need:

- A valid passport (6+ months validity recommended)
- An authorized travel category (OFAC for US citizens)
- The e-visa (replacing the tourist card)
- A completed D'Viajeros health declaration
- Proof of travel insurance (some airlines require this)

## How to Get Your Cuba E-Visa

Apply online through an authorized provider like Cuba Travel Services. Choose Standard ($85), Express ($135), or Signature ($225) based on your timeline and needs. Express and Signature packages include D'Viajeros form assistance.`,

    content: `## Is Travel Insurance Required for Cuba?

**Yes.** Cuba requires all incoming travelers to have valid health insurance that covers medical expenses on the island. Cuban immigration officials can ask for proof of insurance upon arrival, though enforcement varies.

## Why US Citizens Need Special Attention

Most US-based health insurance plans — including Medicare — **do not provide coverage in Cuba** due to the trade embargo. This means US travelers almost always need to purchase separate travel insurance that explicitly covers Cuba.

## What Should Your Cuba Travel Insurance Cover?

At minimum, your policy should include:

- **Medical expenses** — Illness, injury, and hospitalization in Cuba
- **Emergency evacuation** — Medical evacuation to the US or a third country
- **Trip cancellation** — Reimbursement for non-refundable trip costs
- **Baggage loss/delay** — Coverage for lost or delayed luggage

## How Much Does Cuba Travel Insurance Cost?

For a typical 7–10 day trip, expect to pay:

- **Basic coverage:** $30–$60
- **Comprehensive coverage:** $80–$150
- **Premium coverage (with evacuation):** $150–$300

Prices vary based on your age, trip duration, and coverage limits.

## Can I Buy Insurance at the Airport in Cuba?

Yes — Cuba offers insurance at the airport through Asistur, the state-run insurance company. However:

- It may cost more than pre-purchased policies
- Coverage limits may be lower
- The purchase process adds time to your arrival

**Recommendation:** Purchase travel insurance before your trip from a US-based provider that explicitly covers Cuba.

## What Happens If You Need Medical Care in Cuba?

Cuba has a well-regarded healthcare system. If you need medical attention:

1. Contact your insurance provider's emergency line
2. Visit a clinic designated for international patients (Clínica Central Cira García in Havana is the most common)
3. Keep all receipts and documentation for insurance claims
4. Payment is typically required upfront — you'll file for reimbursement later

## Key Takeaways

- Travel insurance is **mandatory** for Cuba entry
- US health insurance typically doesn't cover Cuba
- Buy Cuba-specific coverage before your trip
- Keep proof of insurance accessible during travel
- Budget $50–$150 for a standard policy`,

    readTime: "6 min read",
    content: `## Do Cuban-Born Americans Need a Cuban Passport?

**Yes.** Under Cuban law, anyone born in Cuba is considered a Cuban citizen, even if they've become a naturalized US citizen. To enter Cuba, Cuban-born Americans need:

- A valid **US passport** (for re-entry to the United States)
- A valid **Cuban passport** (for entry into and exit from Cuba)
- A Cuba **e-visa** (travel authorization)

## How to Renew Your Cuban Passport in the US

### Step 1: Gather Required Documents

- Current (or expired) Cuban passport
- US passport or other government-issued ID
- Cuban birth certificate (if available)
- Two recent passport-sized photos (specific Cuban format requirements)
- Completed application form

### Step 2: Choose Your Service Method

**Option A: Cuban Embassy/Consulate**
- Visit the Cuban Embassy in Washington, DC or consulate locations
- Longer processing times (4–8 weeks typical)
- Limited appointment availability

**Option B: Authorized Consular Service Provider**
- Cuba Travel Services offers Cuban passport renewal from $150
- We handle the consulate interaction on your behalf
- Faster processing with status updates

### Step 3: Processing Timeline

- **Standard processing:** 6–8 weeks
- **Priority processing:** 3–4 weeks (when available)
- **Emergency processing:** Case-by-case basis

## Cuban Passport Renewal Costs

| Service | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Consulate fee | Varies by passport type |
| Service provider fee | From $150 |
| Photo service | $15–$25 |
| Shipping | $20–$40 |

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Expired for More Than 2 Years
If your Cuban passport has been expired for over 2 years, you may need a "prórroga" (extension) or a completely new passport. Requirements differ from a standard renewal.

### Lost Cuban Passport
If you've lost your Cuban passport, you'll need to apply for a replacement rather than a renewal. Additional documentation may be required, including a police report.

### Name Changes
If your name has changed since your last Cuban passport (due to marriage, for example), additional documentation is required including certified marriage certificates.

## Why Cuba Travel Services?

We are one of the few US-based providers that offers full Cuban consular services, including:

- Cuban passport renewal
- Cuban birth certificate requests
- Legalization of documents
- Power of attorney for Cuban matters
- Consular letter requests

Most competitors only offer e-visa services. Our direct consulate contract allows us to provide the full range of consular services Cuban-born Americans need.`,

    content: `## Do Cruise Passengers Need a Cuba Visa?

**Yes.** All travelers entering Cuba — whether by air or by sea — need a valid Cuba e-visa. Cruise passengers are not exempt from this requirement.

## How Cruise Visa Requirements Differ

While the e-visa itself is the same, cruise travelers should note:

### Port of Entry
- Air travelers enter through Cuban airports (primarily HAV)
- Cruise passengers enter through designated ports (Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Cienfuegos)

### Shore Excursion Requirements
- Your shore activities must align with your declared OFAC travel category
- Most cruise lines organize "Support for the Cuban People" excursions
- Independent shore excursions are permitted but must comply with OFAC guidelines

### Documentation at Port
- Have your e-visa accessible (digital or printed)
- D'Viajeros may be required for cruise passengers — check current requirements
- Your passport will be stamped by Cuban immigration

## Cruise Lines Operating Cuba Routes

Several major cruise lines offer Cuba itineraries, though availability changes frequently due to regulatory changes. Check with your cruise line for current Cuba port calls.

## OFAC Compliance for Cruise Passengers

The same 12 OFAC travel categories apply to cruise passengers as to air travelers. Your cruise line will typically:

1. Have you sign an OFAC affidavit before the Cuba port call
2. Offer compliant shore excursions
3. Provide documentation guidance

**Important:** The cruise line's documentation does not replace your personal e-visa requirement.

## How to Get Your Cuba Cruise Visa

Apply through Cuba Travel Services the same way air travelers do:

- **Standard ($85):** Email delivery, same-day processing
- **Express ($135):** ~10-minute delivery with D'Viajeros assistance
- **Signature ($225):** Full VIP service package

Our system accommodates cruise-specific requirements including port-of-entry details and multi-port itineraries.

## Tips for Cuba Cruise Travelers

1. **Apply for your e-visa before boarding** — Don't wait until you're at sea
2. **Keep hard copies** — Internet access on cruise ships can be limited
3. **Exchange currency on the ship** — Cuban banks at port may have long lines
4. **Book compliant excursions** — Ensure your activities match your OFAC category
5. **Bring cash** — US credit cards generally don't work in Cuba`,

    readTime: "7 min read",
    content: `## 1. Cash Is King

US credit and debit cards generally **do not work in Cuba** due to the trade embargo. Plan to bring sufficient cash (USD or Euros) for your entire trip. You can exchange currency at:

- Cadecas (official exchange houses)
- Banks
- Your casa particular host (sometimes at slightly worse rates)

**Pro tip:** Bring clean, undamaged bills. Cuban exchange offices may reject torn or heavily worn notes.

## 2. Internet Access Is Limited

WiFi is available but not ubiquitous. You'll find it at:

- Hotels (often the most reliable)
- ETECSA WiFi parks (outdoor hotspots)
- Some restaurants and casas particulares

Purchase an ETECSA card or use your hotel's WiFi service. Download offline maps (Maps.me works well) before arriving.

## 3. Stay at a Casa Particular

Private homestays (casas particulares) are the best way to experience Cuban culture and comply with the "Support for the Cuban People" OFAC category. Benefits include:

- Direct support for Cuban families
- Home-cooked meals (often the best food in Cuba)
- Local knowledge and recommendations
- More affordable than hotels

## 4. Learn Basic Spanish

While you'll find some English speakers in tourist areas, basic Spanish goes a long way. Essential phrases:

- "¿Cuánto cuesta?" (How much?)
- "¿Dónde está...?" (Where is...?)
- "La cuenta, por favor" (The check, please)
- "No entiendo" (I don't understand)

## 5. Classic Cars Are Transportation

Those iconic 1950s American cars aren't just photo props — many serve as taxis. Options include:

- **Almendrones:** Shared classic car taxis on fixed routes (very cheap)
- **Private taxis:** Negotiate the fare before getting in
- **Coco taxis:** Three-wheeled yellow coconut-shaped taxis (fun but bumpy)
- **Bici-taxis:** Bicycle rickshaws for short distances

## 6. Eat at Paladares

Paladares (privately owned restaurants) offer the best food in Cuba. State-run restaurants tend to be underwhelming. Ask your casa particular host for recommendations — the best paladares are often not on Google.

## 7. Tipping Is Important

Cuba has a tipping culture. General guidelines:

- Restaurants: 10–15% of the bill
- Casa particular staff: $3–5 CUP equivalent per day
- Musicians at restaurants: $1–2 CUP equivalent per song
- Tour guides: $5–10 CUP equivalent per day

## 8. Bring Supplies to Share

Basic supplies that Cubans appreciate:

- Over-the-counter medications (aspirin, vitamins)
- Toiletries (soap, toothpaste, shampoo)
- School supplies for children
- Clothing in good condition

This also aligns with the "Support for the Cuban People" OFAC category.

## 9. Explore Beyond Havana

While Havana deserves several days, consider day trips or overnight excursions to:

- **Viñales Valley:** Tobacco farms and stunning karst mountains
- **Trinidad:** Perfectly preserved colonial town (UNESCO World Heritage)
- **Varadero:** Beach resort area (2 hours from Havana)

## 10. Get Your Documents Right Before You Go

The most stressful part of a Cuba trip should NOT be documentation. Before departure, ensure you have:

- ✅ Valid US passport
- ✅ Cuba e-visa (apply at CubaVisaServices.com)
- ✅ D'Viajeros health declaration
- ✅ Travel insurance with Cuba coverage
- ✅ OFAC category selected and documented
- ✅ Sufficient cash for your trip`,

    content: `## The Rise of Cuba Visa Scams

As Cuba travel has grown in popularity, so have fraudulent visa services. Scam operators prey on travelers unfamiliar with the process, charging inflated prices for invalid or delayed visas.

## Red Flags to Watch For

### 🚩 No Verifiable Credentials
Legitimate providers should be able to demonstrate:
- IATA accreditation
- OFAC authorization
- State-level travel seller registration (e.g., Florida Seller of Travel)
- A verifiable business address and phone number

### 🚩 Unusually Low Prices
If a service offers Cuba e-visas for $20–$30, be suspicious. The cost of legitimate consulate processing plus service overhead makes prices below $70 unsustainable for authorized providers.

### 🚩 No Physical Presence
Legitimate providers typically have a physical business location. Scam operations often exist only as a website with no verifiable address.

### 🚩 Delayed Delivery with Excuses
If your visa is "processing" for more than 24 hours with no clear timeline, something may be wrong. Authorized providers with direct consulate contracts can deliver in minutes.

### 🚩 No Customer Service
If you can't reach a real person by phone during business hours, that's a significant red flag.
