# Proposed Changes Based on Competitive/Keyword Strategy

Below are the specific changes, organized so you can approve or deny each one individually.

---

## Change 1: TopBar Text Cleanup
**Current:**
"Express Cuba Visa Processing · Official Authorized Provider · Direct Consulate Contract · Presence at MIA & TPA Airports · Instant Delivery · Official Authorized Provider · Direct Consulate Contract · Staff at MIA & TPA Airports"

**Proposed:**
"Authorized Cuba E-Visa Processing · Direct Consular Coordination · Support Available · Serving U.S. Travelers Since 1999"

**Why:** Removes "Official" (implies government), removes repetition, adds "Since 1999" trust signal.

---

## Change 2: Hero Section H1 + Subtitle
**Current H1:** "The Official Cuba E-Visa Provider"
**Current badge:** "America's #1 Authorized Cuba E-Visa Provider Since 1999"
**Current subtitle:** "The only authorized provider with a direct Cuban Consulate contract..."

**Proposed H1:** "Trusted by U.S. Travelers Since 1999"
**Proposed H2 subtitle:** "Authorized Cuba E-Visa, Cuban Passport, and Civil Document Services -- Secure Online Processing with Direct Consular Coordination."
**Add disclaimer line:** "We are not a government agency."
**Remove badge entirely.**

**Why:** Removes "Official," "#1," and "only" claims. Adds required disclaimer. Broadens services mentioned.

---

## Change 3: Hero Stats Row
**Current:** 4 stats: "15+" years, "500K+" visas, "3" airport offices, "~0 min" processing
**Proposed:** Replace with a 3-item trust row:
- "Secure Checkout"
- "Support Available"
- "Serving U.S. Travelers Since 1999"

**Why:** Strategy says keep above-fold minimal. Unsubstantiated numbers like "500K+" are risky.

---

## Change 4: Hero CTAs
**Current:** No explicit CTAs in hero (pricing cards serve as CTA)
**Proposed:** Add two CTA buttons above the pricing cards:
- Primary: "Apply for Cuba E-Visa" (links to /apply?plan=standard)
- Secondary: "Passport & Consular Services" (links to services section or future page)

**Why:** Strategy requires clear conversion-first above-fold layout.

---

## Change 5: Navigation Restructure
**Current:** Application Process | Airport Locations | Visa Blog | Travel Services | About Us | FAQ

**Proposed:**
- "Visas & Consular Services" (dropdown with: Travel to Cuba (E-Visa), Cuban Passport Services, Birth Certificates & Civil Documents, Help / FAQs)
- "Airport Locations"
- "Insights" (replaces "Visa Blog", links to /insights)
- "Travel Services" (external, keep)
- "About Us" (keep)
- "Apply Now" button (keep)

**Why:** Better keyword alignment, user-intent grouping.

---

## Change 6: Blog to Insights Rename
**Current route:** /blog with H1 "Cuba E-Visa & Travel Insights"
**Proposed:**
- New route /insights (keep /blog redirecting to /insights)
- H1: "Cuba Visa & Consular Insights"
- Nav label: "Insights" instead of "Visa Blog"

**Why:** Strategy directive to replace "Visa Blog" with "Insights."

---

## Change 7: How It Works Simplification (Homepage)
**Current:** 7 detailed steps with add-ons and tooltips
**Proposed on homepage:** 3 simple steps:
1. "Submit Your Application Online"
2. "We Coordinate Through Official Consular Channels"
3. "Receive Your Authorized Documentation"

The full 7-step version stays on the /process page.

**Why:** Strategy says keep it simple and clear on the homepage.

---

## Change 8: TrustStatsBar Cleanup
**Current stats:**
- "Direct" -- "Cuban Consulate contract -- the only consumer provider with this agreement"
- "100%" -- "US airlines operating Cuba routes covered"
- "15 Min" -- "E-visa processing"
- "28 Yrs" -- "IATA accredited · OFAC authorized"

**Proposed:**
- "Direct" -- "Consular coordination for Cuba documentation"
- "100%" -- "US airlines operating Cuba routes covered"
- "15 Min" -- "E-visa application processing time"
- "25+ Yrs" -- "Of Cuba regulatory experience"

**Why:** Removes "the only" claim. Updates years to match "25+" messaging. Simpler descriptions.

---

## Change 9: WhyUsDark Section
**Current heading:** "The Only Full-Service Cuba Travel Provider in the US"
**Current items:** 5 items with "The only US consumer provider..." language

**Proposed heading:** "Why Choose Cuba Visa Services"
**Proposed 4 items:**
1. "25+ Years of Cuba Regulatory Experience" -- "Deep expertise navigating Cuba's documentation requirements since 1999."
2. "Exclusively Focused on Cuba Documentation" -- "Cuba visas, passports, and civil documents are all we do."
3. "Direct Consular Coordination" -- "We work through official consular channels for your documentation."
4. "Mission-Driven Commitment to Constructive Engagement" -- "Supporting Cuban families and facilitating compliant travel documentation."

**Why:** Removes all "only" claims, aligns with strategy's 4 value points.

---

## Change 10: AirportPresence -- Remove "only" Claim
**Current (Southwest card):** "The only Cuba visa service staffed at Southwest's Tampa Cuba operation."
**Proposed:** "Cuba visa service staffed at Southwest's Tampa Cuba operation."

**Why:** Compliance -- cannot claim "only."

---

## Change 11: HeroPricing Footer Text
**Current:** "OFAC-compliant documentation · Direct consulate authorization"
**Proposed:** "Secure checkout · Direct consular coordination"

**Why:** Matches trust language from strategy.

---

## Change 12: Footer Updates
**Current:** "America's most trusted Cuba visa and e-visa provider since 1999."
**Proposed:** "Trusted Cuba visa and e-visa provider since 1999. We are not a government agency."

**Current disclaimer line:** "Not affiliated with the Cuban Government."
**Proposed:** Keep, plus add "We are not a government agency." to the company description.

**Why:** Compliance requirement -- explicit non-government disclaimer.

---

## Change 13: CredentialsBar Terminology
**Current:** "Consulate Contract" badge with sub "Cuban Consulate -- Direct"
**Proposed:** "Consular Coordination" badge with sub "Direct Consular Channels"

**Why:** "Contract" implies exclusivity. "Coordination" is compliant.

---

## Change 14: CTA Section Text
**Current:** "Get Your Cuba E-Visa Application Processed in Less Than 15 Minutes."
**Proposed:** "Get Your Cuba E-Visa Application Processed in 15 Minutes." (remove "Less Than")
Also update subtitle from "most trusted provider" to "trusted provider."

**Why:** Consistency and compliance.

---

## Change 15: Add Mission Section
**New component** placed below ServicesGrid on homepage.
Short "Our Mission" section with 4 bullet points:
- Supporting Cuban families
- Facilitating compliant documentation
- Constructive engagement
- Long-standing commitment to lawful travel and documentation

Institutional tone, non-political, ~100 words.

**Why:** Strategy requires a mission positioning module below service blocks.

---

## Change 16: GeoContentBlock Updates
**Current H2:** "Everything US Citizens Need to Know"
**Proposed H2:** "Everything U.S. Travelers Need to Know"

Add "Who We Serve" block at the bottom referencing: Miami, New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Tampa -- with a note clarifying no physical offices in those cities (except MIA/TPA airports).

Update Q&A terminology to use "E-Visa" primary, "Tourist Card" as synonym.

**Why:** GEO/AI search optimization per strategy.

---

## Change 17: FAQ Updates
Replace current 7 questions with strategy-aligned questions:
1. "Is this visa accepted at the airport?" -- Yes, our e-visa is the authorized electronic replacement for the former tourist card.
2. "Are you authorized to process Cuba visas?" -- Yes. 25+ years of experience, direct consular coordination, IATA accredited, OFAC authorized.
3. "Is this the official Cuba visa?" -- This is the authorized Cuba e-visa. We are not a government agency.
4. "How long does processing take?" -- Applications are typically processed within 15 minutes.
5. "Can U.S. citizens travel to Cuba for tourism?" -- Under 12 OFAC-authorized categories. "Support for the Cuban People" is most common.
6. "Do you work directly with the Cuban consulate?" -- We coordinate through official consular channels.
7. "What is the D'Viajeros form and is it required?" -- Cuba's mandatory digital declaration. Included in Express and Signature packages.

**Why:** FAQ strategy alignment with compliance-safe answers.
